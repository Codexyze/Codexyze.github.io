  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 16, 2025</p>

  <p>
    This privacy policy applies to the Audio Cutter app (the "App"). Your privacy is very important to us. 
    We do not collect, store, or share any personal information on our own servers.  
  </p>

  <h2>📂 What Information We Access</h2>
  <p>The App only accesses local audio files stored on your device in order to provide trimming and editing functionality.</p>

  <h2>🔐 No Personal Data Collection by Us</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> collect or transmit any personal or sensitive user data.</li>
    <li>No audio files, media, or metadata is uploaded to any server.</li>
    <li>No account creation, login, or analytics tracking is performed by us.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📱 Permissions Used</h2>
  <p>To function properly, the App requests the following permissions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>READ_MEDIA_AUDIO</strong> – For accessing audio files (Android 13+).</li>
    <li><strong>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</strong> – For accessing audio files (Android 12 and below).</li>
    <li><strong>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</strong> – For saving the trimmed audio to your device.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These permissions are used strictly for the app’s audio editing features.</p>

  <h2>📡 Ads & Third-Party Services (AdMob)</h2>
  <p>
    The App uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to show advertisements.  
    AdMob may collect certain data automatically to serve personalized or non-personalized ads.
  </p>

  <h3>Types of data AdMob may collect:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Device information (model, OS version, device identifiers)</li>
    <li>Approximate location (based on IP)</li>
    <li>Crash logs & performance data</li>
    <li>Ad interaction data (such as impressions and clicks)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This data is collected directly by Google and not by us.  
    You can choose whether to allow personalized ads through Google's consent mechanisms.
  </p>

  </p>

  <h2>🌐 Internet Usage</h2>
  <p>
    The App requires internet access only for serving advertisements via AdMob.  
    All audio editing features work fully offline.
  </p>

  <h2>👥 Other Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    Apart from Google AdMob, the App does not use any other third-party SDKs or services that collect or process user data.
  </p>
